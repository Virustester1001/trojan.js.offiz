    <h1>I have collected a series of malware from the internet......</h1>
    <h3>some of them were malicious, but most of them were deleted by google......</h3>

                <h2>1. http://goggle.com ---- (2003 --- 2006)</h2>
            </li>
            <article><h3>This malware was made of the valentines day of 1999.
                It is not sure for now what company made it or for what purpose.
                This malware nearly overpowered Google in court but was taken down when Mcafee was invented.
                It was belieed to still exist with the URL of <a href="http://goggle.org">goggle.org</a> or <a href="http://goggle.com">goggle.com</a> (note that this link is not malicious)
                I checked the wayback machine to track this malware but the wayback machine did not have a record of it. (so sad....)</h3>

                    Anyways, i checked out goggle.cc and found out that it was actually a search engine!
                Although it was not popular, some people visited it before it was taken down....
